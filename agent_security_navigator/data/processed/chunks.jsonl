It mirrors the disinhibition of threat actors motivated by state strategies or hacktivism as well as criminal opportunities. In this environment, espionage, sabotage, disinformation and extortion are becoming increasingly intertwined. The long-term state of war on Europe's doorstep, the risks of polarization of the Hamas-Israel war, and the rise in tensions in the Indo-Pacific arc all remind us that security remains and will remain even more so tomorrow at the heart of organizations' technological and human development strategies.

But there’s no denying that the 12 months of cybersecurity captured in this report have been extraordinary. The tempo, the severity, the complexity, and the consequences of developments in our domain have accelerated to dizzying levels. Our World Watch service published 491 advisories for the period October 2022 through September 2023, averaging over 40 advisories per month. No advisories with Urgency Critical were issued for the period. This is somewhat astonishing given the almost overwhelming scale and frequency of security ‘drama’ that occupied our minds.

Cl0p was credited with exploiting vulnerabilities in the public facing managed file transfer (MFT) solution of MOVEit Transfer by vendor Progress Software. This was the third MFT solution Cl0p exploited in almost three years. In early February 2023 news reports of victims associated with another MFT called GoAnywhere emerged[1]. This time a 0-day was targeted in Internet-facing GoAnywhere services and was a repeat of the playbook that CL0p was starting to perfect. We’ve been tracking Cl0p for 41 months now.

Cl0p accounts for 373 victims in 2023, significantly inflating the 2563 victims recorded for this period from other actors. The ‘Finance and Insurance’ sector in particular recorded a 106% increase in Cy-X victims, largely at the hands of Cl0p.

Microsoft faces the STORM (-0558) In 2023, Microsoft announced that an attacker, identified as STORM-0558, gained unauthorized access to Exchange Online data hosted in Azure by abusing Outlook Web Access (OWA)[2]. The attackers had targeted a subset of accounts belonging to specific organizations.

The crash dump was allegedly obtained from a compromised Microsoft engineer’s debug workstation, to which the dump file had been copied[3].

A Volt of lightning In May 2023, Microsoft reported[13] on the activities of a Chinese threat actor named ‘Volt Typhoon’, that is considered responsible for targeting critical infrastructure providers and other sectors in Guam and elsewhere in the United States. According to Microsoft, Volt Typhoon has been breaching critical infrastructure in the USA since 2021[14].

Microsoft claims that Volt Typhoon is allegedly affiliated with the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). Notable about the incident is Microsoft’s assessment that Volt Typhoon is ‘pursuing development of capabilities that could disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the United States and Asia region during future crises’.

The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)[44] was presented by the FIRST organization at the BlackHat conference in 2019[45], and seeks to provide clear, accurate predictions on whether vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited.

A judicious application of the EPSS predictions should result in no exploitable vulnerabilities getting missed, while avoiding the ‘wasted effort’ of patching or mitigating issues that aren’t ever exploited. Predicting Hacking EPSS provides a metric that can be used to inform prioritization strategies.

One way to explore the potential value of EPSS as a source of Vulnerability Intelligence is to apply it retrospectively. We could look back at past intelligence reports that reference a CVE. Some of our World Watch advisories meet this criterion. We can create two groupings named ‘Prioritize’ and the other ‘Evaluate’. The former, Prioritize, represents the World Watch Advisories we might need to examine closely and reassess. The Evaluate group should not be discarded but should be revisited at a later stage.

The chart to the left illustrates how one would view our World Watch Advisories if we apply a simple heuristic using EPSS.

First, as noted in previous reports, we believe that the size of the economy plays a role in why victim countries are impacted by Threat Actors. In our first annual Cy-X report, published in June 2023[50], we considered whether the number of businesses registered in a country could explain the geographical distribution in Cy-X victims.

India developing There are other factors that play an important role in shaping the observed victimology, namely language and culture. Obviously, the email and website lures often used to achieve initial access require an actor to be fluent in the victim’s language and have insight into their culture and business practices. Moreover, if stolen data is used to pressure and extort victim organizations, Threat Actors need to understand what they have compromised and what it’s worth to the victim. We believe that regional language and culture might act as a ‘barrier to entry’ to actors outside those regions, and thus served to help shape the victimology.

Although English- speaking countries this year continue to account for the highest numbers of victims, we are seeing a shift to other regions. For example, India has seen the biggest increase in victims over the past 12 months. Given rapid economic growth in the country, this could be expected. According to the World Bank[51], India is one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. On the other hand, India’s victim count is growing from a relatively low base, which we believe may be due to the barriers imposed by language and business culture.

Depending on values, culture, and other contextual factors, businesses in different countries are likely to be more or less approachable to the actor and responsive to the coercion. Like China and Japan, India may be unfamiliar territory for most Cy-X threat actors. And, at the risk of grossly generalizing, we suspect that business culture in India may not respond well to the form of ransom negotiation that makes Cy-X function. These two barriers appear to have been slowly eroding over the past 12 months, causing victim counts to move closer to where the size of the economy predicts. Despite this subtle change, the Indian numbers remain low in comparison with other similarly-sized economies.

This is an interesting observation, given the fact this also marks one year since Russias war against Ukraine broke out and we reported notable disruptions in Cyber Extortion operations. So, what has changed in the ecosystem to cause such an increase? To shed light on this, we explore which Actors are responsible for the compromises we are seeing. Multiple personalities If we’re to believe the self-portrayals of Threat Actors, we are dealing with “honest and simple pentesters” that call their victims “customers” and offer “loyal” conditions in pursuit of the return their hostages – namely the stolen data – to the victims after payment has been received.

Evolving tactics Threat actors continue evolving their tactics, especially their extortion techniques. As previously observed, attacks no longer just involve encryption. But, especially in 2023, we have seen a larger proportion of attacks extorting money only based on stolen data, which we record as Data Extortion. Besides Data Extortion and the classic ransomware, we also observed a small amount of DDoS threats made by the Threat Actor group NoEscape. This is interesting since we last saw threats to DDoS from a long-gone group called Avaddon.

The major players Who were the major Threat Actor groups over the past 12 months? In total, we recorded 54 Cyber Extortion operations with leak sites on the dark web. This is an increase in Threat Actors of 12.5% over 2022. As previously mentioned, the number of victims increased 46% over the same period. This disproportionality suggests how effective this criminal ecosystem has become. Threat Actors observed during this report period are shown below.

However, other Threat Actors have also been busy, and proportionally, we’ve actually been seeing less LockBit3. Another group that sticks out is Cl0p, who we have mentioned on several occasions already. Cl0p is closely followed by Play, who is responsible for 10% of all victims over the past 12 months.

Although this dataset is arguably too small to draw definitive conclusions from, we note with interest that as the Risk Score increases (shown on the X-axis from 1 to 31), the Sightings lag (shown in days on the Y-axis) appears to decrease. Bearing in mind that this refers to the last sighting, it would seem to suggest that the more highly rated the IoC (the ones we have more confidence in) persist in the wild for a shorter time. This may in turn suggest that this high-confidence is indeed more accurate, but that the attacker infrastructure being identified is being recycled quickly.

A dynamic Risk Score provides clients with a means to prioritize indicators, but on a scale of 1-100, the average Risk Score assigned is only 14.39. Furthermore, 98% of IoC have a risk score of 20 or less and only 0.12% of IoC have a Risk Score of 100. It’s very hard to select the best CTI ‘Sources’ also: 50% of all IoC in our Datalake are contributed by just 5 CTI data sources. The most prolific source alone contributes 16%.

How many data sources are enough? Like so many things in security, the ‘effectiveness’ of IoC is also a large blind spot: Since CTI tends to flow in one direction, it’s hard to know what CTI is effective, and how long it remains effective. From the limited insight we have, we assess that the average time between recording the IoC in the Datalake and a confirmed Positive Sighting in the wild is ~ 20 days. However, the majority of IoC that we do observe are not seen again after 5 days, and really 2 days seems to be the expiry time for most CTI. So any process that consumes CTI needs to be highly agile.

The bulk of IoC tend to share the same attributes (source, Risk Score, Updates, etc), but that is always followed by a ‘long tail’ of IoC that have diverse attributes. This pattern is so consistent across the distributions we visualize in the study above that the charts can be hard to tell apart! This kind of distribution beautifully captures the ‘intelligence dilemma’ we discuss above, which is classic ‘Pareto Principle’[58]: The majority of the apparent value we get from CTI is highly concentrated in a few sources, with an average Risk Score and will persist for around 2 days.

At the same time, however, there is a lot of value distributed across other sources, with diverse Risk Scores. Ignoring those indicators means taking the risk of missing crucial intelligence, though the probabilities become even lower. We need both ‘depth’ and ‘breadth’ in the CTI we consider. At the same time, even that is not *all* the intelligence there is, so one is inclined to add even more data. But IoC are duplicated across multiple sources, so the relative ROI decreases even more, although the security value is still there. A few key elements ensure positive security outcomes from CTI: 1. The correct balance between quality and quantity of data; 2. Data context to facilitate effective triage; 3. Minimum ‘friction’ to reduce the cost of applying and acting on CTI; 4.

Additionally, it can always be an opportunity for someone else to fill that void or for the same Threat Actors to re-organize and re-brand.

The Purdue Model describes the conceptual structure and separation of various processes and networks in an organization that utilizes OT. It is important to note that the Purdue Model is only a reference architecture, meaning it is a basic approximation and not something that should directly define an implementation. However, we can use this model to describe OT and its constituent devices, as well as provide a reference point for the types of attack OT may experience.

Next is level 3.5, the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which acts as a separator between IT and OT and therefore the OT’s perimeter. The remaining levels below the DMZ are all OT. Levels 2 and 3 are similar in that they both may monitor, control, and even configure the physical environment. However, level 2 is typically specific to a single cell or process and perhaps even physically close, whereas level 3 is generally centralized, particularly in geographically dispersed organizations.

The different types of OT cyberattack aren’t necessarily defined by the assets that they impact, rather the assets that they target and how they are targeted. More specifically, the precision, skillset, and intent with which they are targeted. While that distinction may sound pedantic, it changes the threat landscape that defenders need to consider and makes it challenging for traditional IT controls to keep up.

They are characterized by the use of only IT tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) but still manage to affect production in some way. There are 3 types of OT cyberattack in this first category. Type 1a: IT targeted The first type, 1a, occurs when the OT environment isn’t even reached by an adversary. So, as far as the adversary is concerned, their attack does not target the victim’s OT.

Alternatively, the OT is disconnected or shut down by the victim as a precaution. Meaning in this type of attack, the OT may only be affected indirectly as the victim attempts to maintain safety and integrity of the OT network. The OT impacts of this can range from a temporary loss of telemetry all the way to complete loss of production and a complex, time consuming process to bring it back online. It is important to note that every OT cyberattack type may also result in a disconnect or shutdown of the OT environment as part of the response and recovery efforts, which would ultimately cause similar affects.

The affected OT assets may include devices such as engineering workstations, Windows-based human machine interfaces (HMIs), and other IT-based technology. Although the adversary has managed to directly affect OT assets, the targeting is generally not deliberate.

This may be to trigger more of a response from the victim or to cause a more serious impact than from just affecting IT. This attack type may deliberately target OT assets, but only those with which an IT-focused adversary would be familiar. There is otherwise no OT-specific intent or utilisation in such an attack, nor is there any precision in the way production is impacted.

When distinguished by the two categories and further broken down into the five types between them, it becomes clear that not all OT cyberattacks are equal, and many are not worthy of the hype. In fact, you might find that under this lens many cyberattacks reported to have been against OT are relatively unremarkable IT cyberattacks that lie in category 1. In fact, the trend of category 1 attacks affecting OT appears to be growing with the ever-increasing interconnectivity between IT and OT. This is due to concepts such as the Industrial Internet of Things[88] and Industry 4.0[89] demanding more telemetry and control, in turn increasing the size and complexity of the OT perimeter and resulting attack surface.

However, as access to knowledge and equipment grows and as adversaries develop OT modus operandi that are relevant to their respective causes, there’s a real possibility that we’ll see a growing number of category 2 attacks.

However, our primary criterion was that each incident must have affected OT, at minimum a type 1a scenario. If an organization uses OT but only their IT was affected by a cyberattack, meaning their production was not affected, we did not consider it to be an OT cyberattack. To further ensure that we had the richest data to work with, an incident was only recorded if we could find at least 4 of the 5 following criteria: 1. Year of incident 2. Country of incident 3.

Fortunately, to facilitate a discussion around that question, we can turn to routine activity theory (RAT)[91].

Either that or they are possibly even intentionally causing threats to safety.

All of this culminates in lowering barriers to entry from a technical perspective. The most fundamental point of this component is the suitability of the victim organisation itself.

This all presents a clearly suitable target in OT-using organizations. Absence of a suitable guardian If criminals consider moving away from conducting category 1 Cy-X with IT TTPs, it will primarily be in response to effective guardianship from IT cyber security controls.

As we can see from the 35 years of historical attacks, there hasn’t been a publicly reported Cy-X attack that deliberately targeted PLCs. That might be because traditional, encryption- based ransomware isn’t quite effective (or perhaps even achievable) against them. Firstly, the criminal would require specific vendor/device exploits to attain root level access on each device they want to target, which means attacks across multiple organizations that utilize different vendor ecosystems are hard to scale.

However, you don’t need to rely on IT TTPs or encrypt PLCs to perform Cy-X against OT, because in OT we have something that can be targeted that isn’t possible in IT Cy-X attacks – the physical world. Dead Man’s PLC starts at the engineering workstation, the asset where engineers will create configurations and load them onto PLCs across the OT environment.

When the criminal is on the engineering workstation, they can view existing ‘live’ PLC code in their project files, edit them, and download new configurations to the PLCs. Dead Man’s PLC takes advantage of this capability, as well as existing OT functionality and seldom-used security controls, to hold the victim’s entire operational process and, by proxy, the physical world to ransom.

If the polling network detects any attempt from the victim to respond to the attack, or the victim does not pay their ransom in time, polling will cease, and Dead Man’s PLC will trigger akin to a Dead Man’s switch and detonate. Detonation involves deactivating the legitimate PLC code, responsible for the control and automation of the operational process, and activation of malicious code that causes physical damage to operational devices.

Instead, it depends on a third-party SSL library known as BoringSSL. While scouring the public source code of this library, we identified that the SSL certificate verification logic resided in the /ssl/ ssl_x509.cc file and the contained ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_ cert_chain function – a function that returns a Boolean indicating whether the SSL certificate is valid. 3 Diving into the Android SDK: Shared Libraries Android Flutter-based applications are primarily driven by two shared libraries: l"}

Information Warfare A crucial component that is supporting cyberwarfare is called information warfare. With information warfare, it is the objective to gain an advantage over the opponent. Unlike traditional analogue warfare and analogue techniques, no large financial resources are needed yet to initiate information warfare; the vast knowledge of systems, networks, applications, and tooling are the only requirements. Some of the possible types/methods and/or tactics to gain an advantage over the opponent are: ▪ Datamining: from the early days of the internet, commercial companies (like Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft) offering online services have been able to collect huge amounts of data on citizens and organizations.

The West is ‘bound’ by digital regulations that curb activities like monitoring of citizens, and they must often deal with new or modified rules and legislation that are often countered by privacy activist groups.

An important contributing factor here is that within the cyber domain, the defense does not know what the offence strategy, strength and/or capabilities are. Moreover, activities within cyberwarfare are often cost efficient and can be conducted almost in real-time. The added advantage on top of that is that these activities are often stealthy.

There are a few things to consider within the cyber domain that may be of impact to cyberwarfare. It is important to address the effects of geopolitics; it is undeniable that political situations or changes in the geopolitical sphere between nation-states can impact cyber activities undertaken.

To be aware of your own position in the cyber domain and your relation to, for instance, governmental bodies, can aid in creating an assessment of the posed risk and the steps you might need to take in making yourself more cyber-resilient.

Secondly, we see how individual hacktivist groups are joining collectives that then enable them to tap into additional resources of this collective and hence increase their capabilities. Examples for this include recent #OpCountry operations such as #OpSweden, #OpAustralia and #OpFrance, in which hacktivists call out to their fellow hacktivists to join a campaign to attack targets in a certain country.

With the beginning of the war, the line between these two extremes began to blur, and at the same time a massive surge in activity could be observed. This was especially apparent after the hacker collective Anonymous declared ‘war’ on Russia[95] and the Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov asked individual hackers on the internet for help at the beginning of the war[96][97], creating the first IT Army of Ukraine[98].

Targeting can be highly opportunistic, which greatly exacerbates the technical asymmetry already faced by defenders in cyberspace. In ‘conventional’ cyberattacks, it’s already said that “the attacker only has to be lucky once”.

Our teams are always on the lookout for new and emerging trends. Let’s summarize 4 main key take aways learnt from this past year. Firstly, one of the most striking trends we notice is the rising number of ransomware victims. Unfortunately, Cyber Extortion (Cy-X) attacks are still highly profitable for criminals - though hopefully that will change as organizations find ways to be more resilient.

However, and additionally, numerous new and younger groups have recently appeared in the ecosystem: they take advantage of ransomware strains that are leaked on cybercriminal forums. Thanks to that, they flourish quickly with much lesser effort. We have noticed an uptick in international cooperation amongst security industry and Law Enforcement to try to take down such “historical” groups (Ragnar Locker, Qakbot, Snake -from Turla, to name but a few). In the cybersecurity world, without borders, international cooperation is key: without it, there's not much which can be done. Unfortunately, even when infrastructures are seized, it isn't uncommon to see the same group back in business a few weeks or months later under a new name.

This politically driven attack successfully disrupted the illegal activities of the Russian-based ransomware gang. With the current geopolitical climate, it wouldn't be surprising to record similar attacks in the future. A second persistent trend in 2023 : the number of detected vulnerabilities has continued to strongly increase. Hackers quickly exploit technical and human flaws (through phishing attacks for instance), so this increase is concerning. And what has been particularly true in 2023, is the increase of exploits using the infamous 0-days (with no patch or correction yet available from the software maker as they are unaware of their existence).

Unfortunately, the confirming trend is that vulnerabilities (among which 0-days) are used as attack vectors even more quickly and more intensively. The defender’s patching response time is crucial in preventing a breach. And in the case of openly disclosed 0-days breaches, it is becoming increasingly important for solution providers to release security fixes as fast as possible. The third trend in 2023 is related to hacktivism behavioral changes increasingly conflictual global geopolitical climate.

Moreover, cyberwarfare, another consequence of the world’s conflictual evolution, has also evolved this year: sabotage, through wipers, to destroy an enemy’s data is way less popular amongst nation-state threat actors, in favor of espionage operations. In some cases, attacks have been conducted to try to influence elections in other countries, and in others we can even notice alliances between nation- states (exchanging cyber expertise for weapons, for instance).

Au cours de l’année écoulée, les équipes d’Orange Cyberdéfense ont observé un paysage de menaces de plus en plus volatile et complexe, qui nécessite à la fois une vigilance constante et une adaptation innovante. Le rapport Security Navigator 2025 présente un examen détaillé de ces dés et, surtout, des mesures proactives qui peuvent transformer les vulnérabilités en opportunités pour une défense plus forte. Les données que nous avons recueillies au cours des douze derniers mois révèlent des changements radicaux. La cyber- extorsion, l’hacktivisme, les attaques basées sur l’IA et les menaces qui pèsent sur les réseaux opérationnels et mobiles ne sont pas simplement des tendances émergentes, mais des réalités qui redessinent le paysage cybernétique.

Un groupe appelé Solntsepyok a revendiqué l’attaque, mais les rapports ontnalement attribué l’attaque au groupe APT russe appeléSandworm [28]. L ’Ukraine a réagi de la même manière. En juin 2024, des rapports [29] ont révélé que l’Ukraine avait lancé plusieurs cyberattaques contre des aéroports russes, dégradant certains sites web de gouvernements locaux et provoquant des retards de vols.

En juillet 2024, SensePost, faisant partie de l’équipe de piratage éthique d'Orange Cyberdefense, a décrit comment un attaquant peut contourner un système de détection et de réponse des postes de travail (EDR) en utilisant la \"décorrélation des attaques” [103].

Deuxièmement, les attaquants n'ont pas besoin de compromettre un système spécique — tout point d'entrée dans un réseau homogène leur donne accès au \"graphique\" de Lambert.

Qu’il s’agisse de la perturbation des dépendances inormatiques ou de l’arrêt du processus OT par excès de prudence, l’OT n’a pas échappé au éau de la Cy-X, ou plus précisément aux rançongiciels basés sur le chirement. © Orange Cyberdefense 2024/2025 78 Security Navigator 2025 Category 1 IT TTPs 2 OT TTPs Type 1a 1b 1c 2a 2b IT targeted IT/OT targeted OT targeted OT targeted, crude OT targeted, sophisticated Characteristics IT attacked, production impacted indirectly as collateral damage IT attacked, Windows/Linux- based OT attacked "}

Étant donné que le paysage n’était pas encore construit, cela a permis aux personnes concernées, les premiers adoptants, d’agir sur la base d’idéaux. Et si certains idéaux varient d’un groupe à l’autre, les actions sont généralementondées sur des idéaux similaires.

Pour les environnements internes de grande taille, nous devons concevoir des architectures immunisées contre la compromission par un système individuel. Cela nécessite trois stratégies : premièrement, minimiser les surfaces d’attaque en supprimant les systèmes inutiles ; deuxièmement, limiter l’impact des attaques grâce à une segmentation solide et à une a"}

Résumé Alors que les menaces de cybersécurité deviennent de plus en plus sophistiquées et imprévisibles, les RSSI, les directeurs techniques et les responsables de la sécurité se trouvent aujourd’hui à la croisée des chemins. Le cyber paysage exige plus que de simples déenses : il requiert une approche proactive et axée sur les renseignements, qui anticipe et atténue les risques avant qu’ils ne se matérialisent.
